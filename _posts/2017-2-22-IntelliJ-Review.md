title: Review of IntelliJ IDEA IDE
author: John Levander

(under development)
IntelliJ is a Java IDE developed by [JetBrains s.r.o.](www.jetbrains.com) In 2014, JetBrains started supporting our open source projects by providing free licenses of IntellJ.  In this blog post, I review the features of IntelliJ that are most popular amongst the members of our development team.

## Feature 1: Built-in developer tools
After being an [Eclipse](www.eclipse.org) user for the better part of a decade, I became accustomed to spending at least an hour configuring my IDE after a fresh install.  When I last used Eclipse, and this very well may still be the case, it didn't come with built-in tools such as revision control systems, build automation tools, or application frameworks.  Users were expected to download the plugins that they need from the Eclipse "Marketplace." This process worked well enough, but by the time you find everything you need and configure each tool, well over an hour could pass before you could get to work.

When I first tried IntelliJ I was surprised to find that most plugins that I needed are included by default.  Within 5 minutes of installing IntelliJ, I was downloading projects from Git and Subversion repositories and building them with Ant and Maven.  A few hours later I even found a database table editor and viewer included that outperfomred a peice of commercial software that I was using.  

I included "Built-in developer tools" as the first feature in my review because this is the feature that really won me over.  Setting up a new installation of IntelliJ usually doesn't require anything more than what's included by default.  

## Feature 2:  Application server support
Most of what my development team produces is either in the form of a web service or a web application, which we delpoy on a Tomcat application server.  Therefore, good application server support is a key requirement for IDEs used by members of the team.  We find IntelliJ to be completely adaquate in this regard for the following reasons:

 1. Built in Tomcat support
 2. Simple server configuration
 3. Separate release and debug environments
 4. Automatic detection and reload of changed resources
 5. Remote debugging support

## Feature 3: Excellent code completion
The code completion feature in IntellJ is comprehensive.

## Feature 4: Analytics

## Feature 5: Support for JSP, HTML, CSS

## Feature 6: Database tool
ssh tunnel support!
